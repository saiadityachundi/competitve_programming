Write a program to print a sequence of numbers denoting denominations
given as input(along with an amount), in descending order, such that the
given amount is formed from the sequence using minimum number of elements.
If no such sequence is possible, print -1.

input:
The first line input consists of space separated integers denoting the
denominations.
The second line contains a single number, which is the amount to be
formed using the denominations.

output:
Print space separated integers in descending order, whose sum makes the
amount given. If no such sequence is possible, print -1.

Example:
-#1-
Input:
1 2 5
12
Output:
5 5 2
-#2-
Input:
1 2
4
Output:
2 2
